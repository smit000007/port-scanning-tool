Project Description: Multi-Function Network Scanning Script
This project is a Bash-based multi-functional network scanning tool designed for penetration testers, network administrators, and cybersecurity professionals. The script leverages Nmap, a powerful network scanning utility, to provide a comprehensive suite of scanning functionalities in an interactive and user-friendly format.

Key Features:
Interactive Menu:

A dynamic menu allows users to select various scanning options effortlessly.
Animated banner enhances user experience.
Core Functionalities:

Ping Scan: Quickly checks if a target IP address is active.
Fast Port Scan: Performs a high-speed scan for open ports.
Specific Port Scan: Allows targeting specific ports or ranges (e.g., 22, 80-443).
Service Version Detection: Identifies software running on open ports.
Operating System Detection: Attempts to deduce the OS of the target.
Traceroute Scan: Maps the network route to the target.
TCP SYN Scan: Conducts a stealthy TCP handshake scan.
UDP Scan: Identifies open UDP ports.
Vulnerability Scan: Uses Nmap's scripting engine to detect known vulnerabilities.
HTTP Service Scan: Searches for open HTTP/HTTPS services.
Customizability:

Target IP or domain is prompted once and used throughout the session.
Options for granular control of scanning techniques.
User Feedback and Flow:

Clear output with color-coded messages for better readability.
Pause after each operation, allowing users to review results before returning to the menu.
Portability:

Script is self-contained and compatible with most Unix-like systems with Nmap installed.
Use Cases:
Identifying vulnerabilities in network configurations.
Mapping open services for security audits.
Testing compliance with cybersecurity standards.
Educational tool for network security training.
Prerequisites:
Nmap installed on the system.
Basic understanding of networking and security scanning.
This project demonstrates a balance between functionality and usability, making it an essential addition to the toolkit of cybersecurity practitioners.
